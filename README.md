# Kosmorro HTML generator

**Note:** this is a work in progress, not ready for production. Please use with caution.

This repository contains the code to generate HTML files from the ephemerides and events calculated by the Kosmorrolib library.
It is designed to be integrated into Kosmorro at first place, but it can be used outside too.
